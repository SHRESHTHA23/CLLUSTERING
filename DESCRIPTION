DESCRIPTION

TASK1
In task 1 for classification I followed the approach for clustering and as the given data is unsupervised. I am using Kmeans clustering and word2vec 
for tokenizing the docs per cluster. The K= 5 in the code that I used for clustering. 

The clustering approach used is document based clustering as I am using the features as ‘TAGLINE’ and “TAGS” and combining these features into on text column. 
For university/schools and government and unclassified dataset I gave the naming to clusters by visualising the hash map or tokenised them after getting the clustering results 
and converting into entity types. 

For mature and start-up companies after performing clustering I concatenate the datasets for two clusters that I suppose are for start-up and mature companies by 
using Launch Date to classify them according to date and just used a simple where approach on panda’s data frame for achieving this result.

Optimization possible

In task 2 I  tried to use both tfidf and word2vec for text mining  and tfidf was not giving good results at first but then I made more changes and used word2vec.
I can optimize the more code by using tfidf  again and test the model  for clustering .
